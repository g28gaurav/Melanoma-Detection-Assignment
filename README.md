## General Information
This assignment focuses on building a multiclass classification model using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The primary objective is to develop a solution capable of accurately detecting melanoma, a type of skin cancer known for its potential severity if not identified early.
Given that melanoma accounts for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths, creating an automated system to analyze dermatological images and alert dermatologists could significantly enhance diagnostic efficiency and reduce the workload on healthcare professionals. 
The dataset utilized for this project comprises 2,357 images sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), covering various oncological diseases, including melanoma and benign skin conditions.
### Problem Statement: 
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## CNN Architecture Design
To classify skin cancer using skin lesions images. To achieve higher accuracy and results on the classification task, I have built custom CNN model.

Rescalling Layer - To rescale an input in the [0, 255] range to be in the [0, 1] range.

Convolutional Layer - Convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer.A convolution converts all the pixels in its receptive field into a single value. For example, if you would apply a convolution to an image, you will be decreasing the image size as well as bringing all the information in the field together into a single pixel.

Pooling Layer - Pooling layers are used to reduce the dimensions of the feature maps. Thus, it reduces the number of parameters to learn and the amount of computation performed in the network. The pooling layer summarises the features present in a region of the feature map generated by a convolution layer.

Dropout Layer - The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.

Flatten Layer - Flattening is converting the data into a 1-dimensional array for inputting it to the next layer. We flatten the output of the convolutional layers to create a single long feature vector. And it is connected to the final classification model, which is called a fully-connected layer.

Dense Layer - The dense layer is a neural network layer that is connected deeply, which means each neuron in the dense layer receives input from all neurons of its previous layer.

Activation Function(ReLU) - The rectified linear activation function or ReLU for short is a piecewise linear function that will output the input directly if it is positive, otherwise, it will output zero.The rectified linear activation function overcomes the vanishing gradient problem, allowing models to learn faster and perform better.

Activation Function(Softmax) - The softmax function is used as the activation function in the output layer of neural network models that predict a multinomial probability distribution. The main advantage of using Softmax is the output probabilities range. The range will 0 to 1, and the sum of all the probabilities will be equal to one.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, the development of a CNN-based model for melanoma detection has the potential to make significant strides in dermatological diagnostics. 
By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can learn to distinguish between various types of skin lesions, including malignant melanomas and benign conditions.

During the model-building process, we built three models and made several key observations:

Observation After Model 1: The initial model exhibited signs of overfitting, as indicated by the growing gap between training accuracy and validation accuracy with increasing epochs. 
This highlighted the need for regularization techniques to enhance generalization.

Observation After Model 2: After implementing an appropriate data augmentation strategy and adding dropout layers, the overfitting issue was somewhat reduced. 
However, the overall model performance did not significantly improve. This prompted us to investigate the distribution of classes within the training set to check for class imbalance, which could be affecting the modelâ€™s ability to learn effectively.

Observation After Model 3: In the final model, we addressed the class imbalance using the Augmentor library for more balanced data augmentation. 
This resulted in improved training and validation accuracy, indicating better model performance. Although the overfitting issue was somewhat mitigated, a gap remained between training and validation accuracy. 
Nevertheless, the class rebalancing proved beneficial for augmentation and achieving the best possible training and validation accuracy.
